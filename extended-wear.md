# Extended Wear Configuration

[← Back to Manual](index.md)

The Extended Wear Configuration is intended for situations where the brooch needs to run for a longer period of time.

This configuration does not use the Raspberry Pi or camera.

Instead, it uses the **Standalone Controller**.

---

## What It Does

The Standalone Controller runs a simple random-motion program.

The brooch will:

- Look left and right automatically
- Blink automatically
- Run without computer vision
- Operate for significantly longer than the Raspberry Pi configuration

Expected runtime is approximately **1.5 hours or more**, depending on battery condition and servo activity.
